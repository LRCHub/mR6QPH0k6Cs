```
I'll tell you all something man
This girl man
I used to love we was together
She left, She with this other
guy
Its really blowing my mind
right now
George man I gotta tell you
about it
I was up in the VIP section
I've seen her with her
girlfriends dancin'
With her tight blue jeans and
stilettos on
I thought about our last convo
on the telephone
And I said girl I'm going on a
tour
I'll be gone for 4 months
So why don't we just break it
on off for 4 months
She said boy if you leave you
so nuts
'Cause Imma just move on
And you gonna be so crushed
Never thought I'd bump into you
With another guy under your arm
Now I know that I was a fool
Fool of my girl, fool of my
girl
The whole time that you were
with me
My friends said I did you wrong
And now it's easy to see
It just took too long
That was the last time
'Cause the last time
I said goodbye to you
(said goodbye to you)
You may scroll down and join
the discussion
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
You keep on blocking my calls
So now I know how it feels
And it hurts
What goes around comes around
The pain is so real
I see you two so happy
Don't know what to do (Oh)
I'm lost without you (Nooo)
It was the last time
'Cause the last time (Ohhh)
Don't wanna say goodbye (say
goodbye)
Don't wanna say goodbye to you
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Jeah, momma said
Boy she with a keeper
But now I understand
Why I'm sick with a fever
That's why I run around
With the models and divas
Drinkin' away the pain
With the henni and tequila
If I could take it all back I
would
I'd take it back to the days
Where our love was all good
When I used to have you
On the bed, legs spread
Instead, I'm listening to the
words you always said
On the real
Doesn't matter what's been said
or done
How I feel
Don't you know that your the
only one
Last time,
I took you for granted
When you were mine
Please forget about the last
time
Let's talk
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
Last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
