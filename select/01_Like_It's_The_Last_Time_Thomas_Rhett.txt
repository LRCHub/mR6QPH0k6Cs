Throw on your boots and your jeans
With the worn out seams
And your goin' out shirt
Put some shine on your truck
Get it all cleaned up just to kick it in the dirt
You put it in drive, start comin' alive
You point them high beam lights into drive, start comin' alive
You point them high beams lights into Friday night
An you swear this life never burns as bright
As It does now

So Soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to 10
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time

Build you a fire, sing along
To a feel good song
At the top of your lungs
Grab a jar, twist the top
Hold your breath, take a shot
Feel the fire on your tongue
And let it drown your pride and your butterflies
Tell the girl you like what you're feelin' tonight
And pull her in tight, let the sparks ignite
Like the Fourth of uly

So Soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to 10
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time

You'll be together like this
Like it's the last time
You're ever gonna taste that kiss

So Soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to 10
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time

Yeah buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right,
Whoah, like it's the last time
Yeah like it's the last time
