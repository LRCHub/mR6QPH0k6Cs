Yes! Yes! Oh!
The ashes of the Great Seal
Begging for numbers
Yes! Yes! Oh!
The happenstance made it real
Faking the plunders

Go past the gates where the garden is laid
Crawl through the desert with lips salivate
Open the cave that you buried away
And found geocache it's not enough

With the masses enlisted
And now you just have to know
With the system insisted
And now they won't let you go

Yes! Yes! Oh!
The ashes of the Great Seal
Begging for numbers
Yes! Yes! Oh!
The happenstance made it real
Faking the plunders

And I never said that I would accuse you
It's just how it went, no feelings attached to
Be thankful you're dead
My head's already there
'Cause my head's already there

Stepping out on this great abyss
It's blissful thoughts that rush in and past expire
What had once existed, co-founding head pounding
Side armored slit wrist
If I don't love then I don't exist
And what a waste of tectonic plates
And forbade all pure thought
Fifty state parking lot and trucker stop
Capitals gamble have a good night attitude
And sample all the germs in terms we can understand

Yes! Yes! Oh!
The ashes of the Great Seal
Begging for numbers
Yes! Yes! Oh!
The happenstance made it real
Faking the plunders

And I never said that I would accuse you
It's just how it went, no feelings attached to
Be thankful you're dead
My head's already there
'Cause my head's already there
'Cause my head's already there
And would you even care?
I feel like you'd rather end
Just end it all instead

I never said this, never said this
I never said this, never said this
I never said this, never said this
I never said this, never said this
I never said this, never said this
I never said this, never said this
I never said this, never said this
I never said this, never said this
